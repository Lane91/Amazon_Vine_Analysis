## Summary

In the paid reviews we saw a 5 star percentage of 51% while in the unpaid reviews we only saw 39%, showing that there is a positivity bias. For additional analysis we could find the number of unpaid reviews for 1 star ratings, then we could look at just paid reviews and see where the 1 star unpaid reviews stack up.
